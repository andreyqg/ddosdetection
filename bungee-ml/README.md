# BUNGEE-ML

BUNGEE-ML is a BUNGEE evolution and our most recent publication. It is a hybrid approach that combines the fast processing of the data plane and the high capacity and the intelligence of the control plane for DDoS mitigation. BUNGEE-ML continuously monitors traffic at the data plane to detect network anomalies and supplies machine learning models (running in the control plane) with inputs to perform in-depth traffic analysis. We refer to this as vertical cooperation. Additionally, our approach progressively pushes malicious traffic farther away from the victim through horizontal mitigation coordination between forwarding devices.

Once our paper is published (currently under review), you will find here all the artifacts and information about.
