# DATASETS

Here you find information about the datasets we used to evaluate our mechanism, as described in our paper.

## The CAIDA "DDoS Attack 2007" Dataset

This dataset contains approximately one hour of anonymized traffic traces from a DDoS attack on August 4, 2007 (20:50:08 UTC to 21:56:16 UTC). This type of denial-of-service attack attempts to block access to the targeted server by consuming computing resources on the server and by consuming all of the bandwidth of the network connecting the server to the Internet.

## The CAIDA Anonymized Internet Traces 2016 Dataset

This dataset contains anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's passive
monitors in 2016. It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago'
high-speed monitor. [More info and download here](https://catalog.caida.org/details/dataset/passive_2016_pcap).

## The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity DDoS Evaluation Dataset (CICDDoS2019) 

CICDDoS2019 contains benign and the most up-to-date common DDoS attacks, which resembles the true real-world data (PCAPs). [More info](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html) and [download here](http://205.174.165.80/CICDataset/CICDDoS2019/Dataset/).
