# DATASETS

Here you find information about the datasets we used to evaluate our mechanism, as described in our paper.

### The CAIDA "DDoS Attack 2007" Dataset
This dataset contains approximately one hour of anonymized traffic traces from a DDoS attack on August 4, 2007 (20:50:08 UTC to 21:56:16 UTC). This type of denial-of-service attack attempts to block access to the targeted server by consuming computing resources on the server and by consuming all of the bandwidth of the network connecting the server to the Internet.
